    "section": "Course Description",
    "text": "Course Description\nFunctional Data Analysis (FDA) is a branch of statistics focused on the analysis and interpretation of data on a continuum, meaning that they can be described naturally as smooth curves or functions. Recent technological advances allow collection of data at such high-frequency that classical multivariate statistical techniques are not able to fully capture and describe their complexity, resulting in the flourishing of functional data methodology. FDA can easily be thought of as the collection of all statistical methodologies needed to handle samples of curves. These include mostly classical multivariate statistical methods adapted to the infinite dimensional case, such as regression models, inference, dimensional reduction, and clustering. However, methods that are specifically needed in this context have also been developed, such as data smoothing and registration. FDA methods have been applied quite broadly, from medicine to engineering, from business, to demography and social sciences, affecting nearly all fields of science. This course offers an introduction to FDA from a methodological viewpoint and gives practical guidance to R packages used in such context."

At the end of the course the students should be able to:\n\nidentify situations in which they can treat their data as functional\napply standard FDA techniques (data description, dimensionality reduction, clustering, regression, and inference)\nvisualize the results\n\nThe course will last 4 days, comprising lectures connected to practical hands-on sessions."
